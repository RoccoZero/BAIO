# BAIO

BAIO (*Beminee All in One*) is a All-in-One hero script solution, written for [Ensage](https://www.ensage.io/). 

Before, it was provided as a closed source software by a purchasable lifetime license. It sold almost a thousand copies, received well over +1200 updates and estimated to ruin around a million games. Since Ensage is shutdown, no reason to keep it closed source anymore.

It's provided as is, no support will be given. You are free to do whatever you want with this code as long as you follow GNU General Public License v3.0 requirements, a copy of the license is provided with this project.

BAIO project contains, pre-made solutions for specific heroes, often provide a precise combo with premade casting order.

BAIO.DynamicCombo serves as an activator for Dynamic Combo solution. It's a highly customizable, generic solution for heroes that are not supported by BAIO.

# Final thoughts

The project, overall, is all over the place. This is what happens when you work on something for over 2 years, all by yourself. The code is not documented but I always tried to follow [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions). 

Ensage was a fun little experience for me, met with a lot of nice people working there. Really appreciate everyone that contributed to BAIO or Ensage in any way. Hope to meet you in other projects as well! -beminee
